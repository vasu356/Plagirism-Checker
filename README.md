# Plagirism Checker
 I created a project to check for plagiarism using a simple and efficient Python code. By employing techniques like TF-IDF and cosine similarity, I compared different text documents for similarity. The code preprocesses the text, calculates the cosine similarity, and highlights potential plagiarism by printing the similarity scores. It's a helpful tool for ensuring originality and authenticity of written content.
